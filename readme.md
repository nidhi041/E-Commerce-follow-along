# Milestone 3 - Backend Setup and Integration

## Overview
In this milestone, you will set up the foundational elements for your backend. You'll organize your backend code efficiently, configure a Node.js server to handle API requests, connect to MongoDB for data management, and implement basic error handling to ensure smooth server operation. By the end of this milestone, your application will be able to handle requests and store data in MongoDB with proper error feedback.

## Tasks

### 1. Backend Folder Structure üóÇ
- Create dedicated folders for organizing your backend code. This includes:
  - routes: Handles routing of incoming requests.
  - controllers: Contains the logic for handling requests.
  - models: Defines the structure and schema of your data (MongoDB).
  - middlewares: Used for functions that run during the request-response cycle (e.g., validation, logging).
  - utils: Utility functions that may be used across the backend code.
  
  Note: Terms like ‚Äúmiddleware‚Äù and ‚Äúutils‚Äù will be explored more in-depth as you progress in the course.

### 2. Server Setup üñ•
- Use Node.js and Express to create the backend server.
- Configure the server to listen on a designated port (e.g., 5000 or 3000).
  
  Steps:
  - Install necessary dependencies like express using npm.
  - Create an Express app and set up a basic route to ensure your server is running.

### 3. Database Connection üíæ
- Integrate MongoDB with your application to store and manage data.
  - Use the mongoose library to define schemas and models.
  - Connect the backend server to MongoDB and ensure the connection is successful.
  - Test database connection by saving a test document or retrieving data from a collection.

### 4. Error Handling ‚ö†
- Implement basic error handling to help with debugging and user feedback.
  - Create a middleware to handle common errors (e.g., 404 for routes that don‚Äôt exist, 500 for server issues).
  - Ensure that error messages are clear and helpful for both the developer and the user.

### 5. Documentation üìñ
- Update your README file to reflect the progress you've made in this milestone.
  - Provide instructions for setting up and running the backend server.
  - Document key components of the backend, such as how the server is structured, how MongoDB is integrated, and how to handle errors.

## Key Features üõ†

- *Backend Folder Structure*: Organizing your code in a modular and maintainable way will make future development easier.
- *Node.js Server*: Setting up and configuring a server to handle incoming API requests.
- *MongoDB Integration*: Storing and retrieving data from a MongoDB database.
- *Error Handling*: Implementing basic error handling to ensure smooth debugging and user experience.

## Expected Outcome
By the end of this milestone, you will have:
- A well-structured backend with clear folder organization.
- A running Node.js backend server.
- A working MongoDB connection for data storage.
- Implemented basic error handling for better app stability.

## Mentor Guidance
During this milestone, your mentor will guide you through:
- Setting up the backend folder structure and files.
- Configuring the server and connecting to MongoDB.
- Writing and testing error-handling code.

# Milestone 5 -Adding SignUp Page

1. Created a Sign-Up Page in React.
2. Implemented form validation for:
      Name (required)
      Email (valid format required)
      Password (minimum 2 characters)
      Password Confirmation (must match password)

4. Used React Router for navigation.

# Milestone 6: User Authentication with Password Encryption

## Overview

In this project, we focus on two key aspects of user authentication:

1. *Encrypting the Password*: Hash the user's password during the signup process using bcrypt to ensure it's stored securely.
2. *Saving User Data*: Store the user's data (e.g., name, email, etc.) in the database, ensuring the password remains encrypted.

## Features

- *Password Encryption*: Uses bcrypt to securely hash and store passwords.
- *Secure User Storage*: Stores user information (name, email, etc.) in the database with encrypted passwords.
- *Database Integration*: Ensures all user data is stored following security best practices.

# Milestone 7:The Login Endpoint

## Overview

This guide covers how to implement a user login endpoint that accepts user credentials (email/username and password), validates the credentials against a database, and uses bcrypt to hash the entered password for secure authentication.

## Features
Accepts login credentials (email/username and password) from the user.
Retrieves user information from the database using the provided credentials.
Uses bcrypt for hashing and comparing passwords securely


# Milestone 8: Product Card Component

## Overview

In Milestone 8, we focus on creating a reusable product card component and designing a homepage to display a collection of these cards. Each card will showcase key product details, such as the product's name, price, and image. The goal is to create a clean and organized layout that improves the user experience and allows for easy browsing of products. This milestone demonstrates the principles of component-based design and how to efficiently manage dynamic content within your app.

## Features

*Reusable Product Card:* A single card component that accepts dynamic product details as props and renders them in a uniform, visually appealing way. The product card includes:

1. Product name
2. Product image
3. Product price

*Dynamic Rendering:* Use of JavaScript array mapping to iterate through a list of products and dynamically render each product's card with its respective data.
*Homepage Layout:* A structured layout, designed using either CSS Grid or Flexbox, to display multiple cards on the homepage in a responsive, organized manner.
*Consistent Design:* The card component ensures that the product details are presented consistently across all cards, providing a seamless user experience

# Milestone 9: Create Product Component

## Overview

### milestone 13: Product Update Feature (MERN Stack)
This feature enables users to edit product details in a MongoDB database via an edit button on the frontend. When the button is clicked, the existing product details are autofilled in a form, where users can make changes and save them. The backend handles updating the data in MongoDB.

# Overview:
1. Backend: Express.js with MongoDB (Mongoose)
2. Frontend: React.js with Axios for API requests
3. Operation: PUT request to update the product details in the database
