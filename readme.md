It contains 4 parts.
User Authentication: Register and log in users.
Product Management: Add, update, and retrieve product data.
Order Handling: Manage customer orders. Each API endpoint will interact with the database and serve data in a structured format (typically JSON). User Authentication: Register and log in users.

# Milestone 3 - Backend Setup and Integration

## Overview
In this milestone, you will set up the foundational elements for your backend. You'll organize your backend code efficiently, configure a Node.js server to handle API requests, connect to MongoDB for data management, and implement basic error handling to ensure smooth server operation. By the end of this milestone, your application will be able to handle requests and store data in MongoDB with proper error feedback.

## Tasks

### 1. Backend Folder Structure 🗂
- Create dedicated folders for organizing your backend code. This includes:
  - routes: Handles routing of incoming requests.
  - controllers: Contains the logic for handling requests.
  - models: Defines the structure and schema of your data (MongoDB).
  - middlewares: Used for functions that run during the request-response cycle (e.g., validation, logging).
  - utils: Utility functions that may be used across the backend code.
  
  Note: Terms like “middleware” and “utils” will be explored more in-depth as you progress in the course.

### 2. Server Setup 🖥
- Use Node.js and Express to create the backend server.
- Configure the server to listen on a designated port (e.g., 5000 or 3000).
  
  Steps:
  - Install necessary dependencies like express using npm.
  - Create an Express app and set up a basic route to ensure your server is running.

### 3. Database Connection 💾
- Integrate MongoDB with your application to store and manage data.
  - Use the mongoose library to define schemas and models.
  - Connect the backend server to MongoDB and ensure the connection is successful.
  - Test database connection by saving a test document or retrieving data from a collection.

### 4. Error Handling ⚠
- Implement basic error handling to help with debugging and user feedback.
  - Create a middleware to handle common errors (e.g., 404 for routes that don’t exist, 500 for server issues).
  - Ensure that error messages are clear and helpful for both the developer and the user.

### 5. Documentation 📖
- Update your README file to reflect the progress you've made in this milestone.
  - Provide instructions for setting up and running the backend server.
  - Document key components of the backend, such as how the server is structured, how MongoDB is integrated, and how to handle errors.

## Key Features 🛠

- *Backend Folder Structure*: Organizing your code in a modular and maintainable way will make future development easier.
- *Node.js Server*: Setting up and configuring a server to handle incoming API requests.
- *MongoDB Integration*: Storing and retrieving data from a MongoDB database.
- *Error Handling*: Implementing basic error handling to ensure smooth debugging and user experience.

## Expected Outcome
By the end of this milestone, you will have:
- A well-structured backend with clear folder organization.
- A running Node.js backend server.
- A working MongoDB connection for data storage.
- Implemented basic error handling for better app stability.

## Mentor Guidance
During this milestone, your mentor will guide you through:
- Setting up the backend folder structure and files.
- Configuring the server and connecting to MongoDB.
- Writing and testing error-handling code.
